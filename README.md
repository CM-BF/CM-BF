### Howdy friends! 👋

I'm glad to e-meet you here. My research interests span from computer vision, graph neural networks, to causality in machine learning and domain generalization. Hope you find my works interesting. I am enthusiastically open to collaboration and actively seeking internship opportunities. If you're interested in working together or have opportunities available, please feel free to reach out to me!
